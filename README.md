Just another docker PHP Stack
=================

This is a tuned PHP stack compatible with the Twelve-Factor methodology including php5, php-fpm and postfix. It's built with performance in mind and settings have been tweaked to suit production deployments. In accordance to the Twelve-Factor methodology it supports environment variables to connect a database (postgres, mariadb, etc) by simply linking this container to your databse container and using environment variables to define a username/password. It also uses postfix which can be configured to use an external SMTP service (mailgun, mandrill, etc) through environment variables.
